## Who Is This For?
- Analysts, PMs, ops — comfortable with tools, not code
- Power users who want repeatable results without wiring everything
- Teams that want a simple, standard way to work locally

## How It Works (In 60 Seconds)
1) Pick a project. Everything you do lives there.
2) Bring in data (or let the agent fetch it).
3) Ask for a report; get HTML, PDF, or Excel.

## Try MCP (Plugins)
- MCP are "plugins" for AI tools — connect to services in a click.
- Prompts:
  - Find an MCP for <your need> on mcp.so
  - Will an MCP help us <your goal>?
  - Install the <X> MCP server

## Actions at a Glance (Prompts)
- 🔧 Set up a demo and run the guided first-project workflow
- 🗂️ Show my projects and resume demo (or create it)
- 🗃️ Show recent outputs for the demo project
- 🧠 Preview the events dataset with a simple SQL
- 🌐 Crawl a website, summarize top pages, and generate a report
- 📝 Render a sample HTML report and export to PDF
- 📦 Run checks and fix formatting/typing issues
